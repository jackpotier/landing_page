# landing_page
The 'Landing Page' Project in Foundations of The Odin Project.

Goal: 
The goal of this project is to build a decent looking landing page for a website of your choice, using a sample image provided.

What went well:
I managed to finish the project in about a day, creating a HTML and CSS landing page with images, flex-boxes, different font styles and boxes for javascript implementation.

What I would do differently: 
1. To make the CSS more readable and effective, I would reduce the number of classes - especially for fonts, by sharing styles with different text classes.
2. To make the CSS better in general, especially for more complex websites, I would give classes more specific and telling names. For example, I would rename 'flex-1a' to 'header-flexbox' to make the code more readable.
3. I will need to start coding in a way that allows the site to be presentable at different screen sizes.
